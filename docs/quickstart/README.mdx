# ⚡ Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Bifrost in under 30 seconds. Choose your preferred integration method below.

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

| Method                                     | Best For                                   | Setup Time  | Next Steps                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| **[🔧 Go Package](go-package)**         | Go applications, direct integration        | ~30 seconds | Direct code integration    |
| **[🌐 HTTP Transport](http-transport)** | Any language, microservices, existing APIs | ~60 seconds | REST API via Docker/binary |

---

## 🔧 **Go Package** - Choose if you:

- ✅ Are building a Go application
- ✅ Want direct code integration and type safety
- ✅ Need custom business logic and advanced features
- ✅ Prefer compile-time configuration validation
- ✅ Want maximum performance with minimal overhead

**→ [Start with Go Package](go-package)**

---

## 🌐 **HTTP Transport** - Choose if you:

- ✅ Want a clean UI for configuration and monitoring
- ✅ Use any programming language (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- ✅ Want to keep AI logic separate from your application
- ✅ Need easy deployment via Docker or binary
- ✅ Prefer configuration via environment variables or config files

**→ [Start with HTTP Transport](http-transport)**

## 💡 Still Not Sure?

### **For Beginners**: Start with **HTTP Transport**
- Easier to set up and test
- Visual interface for configuration
- Works with any programming language
- Can always migrate to Go Package later

### **For Go Developers**: Consider **Go Package** 
- Direct integration with your existing Go codebase
- Type-safe configuration and error handling
- Better performance for high-throughput applications
- More flexible for custom business logic

### **For Teams**: Start with **HTTP Transport**
- Easier for non-Go developers to use
- Centralized configuration and monitoring
- Better for microservices architecture
- UI makes it easier to onboard team members

## 🎯 What's Next?

After completing either quick start:

1. **[Configure Providers](../usage/providers)** - Add more AI providers for redundancy
2. **[Set Up MCP Tools](../mcp)** - Enable AI models to use external tools
3. **[Add Plugins](../plugins)** - Extend Bifrost with custom functionality
4. **[Production Setup](../usage/http-transport/configuration/)** - Deploy to production
