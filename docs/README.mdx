## 🔄 Drop-in API Integrations

After you have set up Bifrost's HTTP transport, you can replace your existing AI provider calls with zero code changes. Bifrost provides 100% compatible endpoints for major AI providers:

| Integration                 | Compatible With                | Instant Migration                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🤖 OpenAI Compatible**    | OpenAI SDK, LangChain, LiteLLM | ✅ [Setup Guide](usage/http-transport/integrations/openai-compatible)    |
| **🧠 Anthropic Compatible** | Anthropic SDK, Claude API      | ✅ [Setup Guide](usage/http-transport/integrations/anthropic-compatible) |
| **🔍 GenAI Compatible**     | Google GenAI SDK               | ✅ [Setup Guide](usage/http-transport/integrations/genai-compatible)     |

```python
# Before (OpenAI)
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="sk-...")

# After (Bifrost) - Same code, multi-provider benefits
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/openai",  # Only change needed
    api_key="dummy-api-key" # Handled by Bifrost
)
```

**Migration Benefits:**

- **🔄 Instant Fallbacks** - Never hit rate limits or downtime again
- **🌐 Multi-provider routing** - Route to any available provider, while keeping your existing codebase
- **🚀 Enhanced Features** - [MCP tools](mcp), [custom plugins](plugins), monitoring
